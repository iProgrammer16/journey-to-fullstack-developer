# Journey to Full-Stack Developer

This repository documents my learning journey towards becoming a full-stack developer. It contains various projects and resources that I've worked on, organized into:

* **front-end**: Projects and exercises focusing on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and front-end frameworks.
* **back-end**: Projects related to server-side programming, databases, APIs, and backend frameworks.
* **Secure Coding**: Applying best practices for writing secure code, including input validation, data protection, and preventing common vulnerabilities such as XSS and SQL Injection.

Along the way, I've explored different technologies and concepts, building practical skills to become a well-rounded developer.

Feel free to explore and learn with me!

🚀 Happy coding!
